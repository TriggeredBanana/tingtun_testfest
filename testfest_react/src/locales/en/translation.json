At the Testfests, website owners and people with disabilities test selected services in different ways. Relevant tools may include various PCs, mobile phones, braille displays, screen readers, screen magnification software, and eye-tracking equipment. The Testfests have already helped the Labour Inspection Authority, Oslo Municipality, NHN, and Storebrand find and fix several issues. To facilitate further use of the research results after the project ends, we will publish methods and software under an open license.",
